							<div class="projectWrapper">
							
							<div class="projectRight">Hysan Place is situated in the heart of Causeway Bay, a thriving area with a  huge footfall of tourists and local alike. The broader aim was to engage with and redirect this footfall into a huge vertical retail environment.<br /><br />
							A complete re-evaluation of the site plan pedestrian access to the lower podium floors benefits both users and commercial activity across the very busy corner of Causeway Bay. <br /><br />
							Planning 17 levels of retail required careful consideration to vertical movement in order to provide even pedestrian irrigation within the tight floor plates. The solution was the introduction of a raised atrium space at level one creating a social gathering hub and a flexible events space adjacent to the neighbouring city streets.  <br /><br />
							This “raised piazza” space connects shoppers to the higher levels via four major means of transport; express escalators on Hennessy Road, a double deck lift system, intermediate lift banks and a split stack escalator bank connecting every floor.<br /><br />
							The interior brief was defined by the client to attract a youthful demographic with elements casual fun and humour, evoking a clean and bright interior. The design solution worked on blending the CWB districts many tenement walk-ups with their eclectic shopping offers. The result was a blending of the surrounding city and the mall interior. <br /><br />
							String-like design elements encourage shoppers to explore the spaces further, both horizontally and vertically. Finally the high level dining atrium at L12 to 14 acts as an anchor drawing shoppers up through the lower levels serving as a place of rest and relaxation where city wide panorama’s can be enjoyed.

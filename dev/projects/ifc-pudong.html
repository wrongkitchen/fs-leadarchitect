							<div class="projectWrapper">
							
							<div class="projectRight">IFC was aimed at 2 contrasting audiences: above ground a luxury offer, and below ground a different set of spaces and retail lifestyle units to appeal more to a younger market. Some of the key design moves included:<br />
							<ul>
								<li>Creation of a distinct Luxury village on the route from the main atrium to the Ritz Carlton hotel</li>
								<li>Collaboration with the graphics team focused on the IFC brand ‘leitmotif’ resulting in the creation of a concept evoking interesting textural qualities within the design </li>
								<li>Use of the external roof levels to activate F&B clusters allowing for pleasurable rooftop dining experiences with citywide views</li>
								<li>Close co-operation with the retailer Apple to conceptualise their glass cylinder flagship plaza store</li>
								<li>Utilising B1 sunken courts to contribute to the Fire Safety plan</li>
							</ul>

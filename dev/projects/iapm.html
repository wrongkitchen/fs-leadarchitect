							<div class="projectRight">There were a lot of opportunities on the table at the start of the iAPM project, but as ever it was how they were combined that truly made a difference. Some of the key design moves included:
							<ul>
								<li>Creation of an L2 Office and Residential address drop-off on the south side to allow strong retail frontages on the Huai Hai road street frontage</li>
								<li>Worked in close collaboration with the local Shanghai planners to create a reduced street set-back to help retain the Huai Hai Road shopping street character</li>
								<li>Use of the external roof levels facing Nanjing Road to activate  3 levels of F&B terraces allowing for roof top dining experiences with city wide views</li>
								<li>close collaboration with the city MTR company to create integrated station entrances to the B2 Retail levels</li>
								<li>Utilising B1 and B2 sunken courts to contribute to the Fire Safety plan</li>
							</ul>

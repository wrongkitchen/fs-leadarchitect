					<p>Experience: Mixed-use developments, high-rise offices and hotels in China, convention centers, residential planning and villa design and golf clubhouses.</p>

					<p>Biography: Jin has 10 years post-graduate experience in the architectural profession, including extensive design and project experience in large scale mixed-use developments, high-rise office and hotel projects in China. His knowledge crosses most stages of projects from inception to completion, including a good understanding of China building and planning codes, experience in planning and detailing, proficiency with 2D rendering and 3D modeling, ability to resolve complex design issues effectively in pressurized situations. He has strong communication skills and the ability to work with multiple consultants on a number of projects simultaneously.</p>

					<p>His education includes an undergraduate program in Tsinghua University, China, then an exchange with the University of Hong Kong, and finally his masters study in University of Michigan, USA. Along the way he has learnt from and been inspired by these diverse school environments. His work experience includes IDS Beijing China, P&T Group Hong Kong, an intense experience in Rafael Vinoly’s New York office, Sundberg Kundig Allen Architects’ Seattle office and KPF’s Hong Kong office, all of which have enriched him with a broader understanding of architectural practices in different cultures and markets.</p>

					<p>Likes: Accept that there are things you don’t like, and you’ll probably be OK with the rest.</p>
					<p>Thinks: It’s time for Architecture to do things again, not just represent things.</p>

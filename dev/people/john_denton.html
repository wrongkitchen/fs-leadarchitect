					<p>Experience: Retail planning, interior architecture and design</p>

					<p>Biography: John is a Director at Lead with his focus being the Interior architectural design of projects. He started his career in the field of Mechanical Production Engineering, completing an apprenticeship in the drawing office of a UK engineering company, which produced specialist machine components.</p>
					<p>It was here where he honed his technical skills on the drawing board, during the age before computers. Although his experience in engineering was rewarding and was a tremendous foundation for the future, it was his passion for design that forced him to change direction and pursue a creative career. Subsequently John has been involved in art and design for almost 30 years, with the last two decades based in Hong Kong.</p>
					<p>His experience has seen him involved in diverse projects throughout Asia in many different market sectors, such as corporate interiors, campus facilities, residential, hospitality, transportation, retail and entertainment; working for large international, as well as local clients. Along the way John has found himself getting involved in other areas of design such as branding, signage, furniture, and even product design – an area where his early career experience is invaluable.</p>
					<p>In 1995, John joined one of the top US architectural practices as a Senior Designer within their interior architecture team. Later he became heavily involved in office operations as well as the role of Design Director within the interior group.</p>
					<p>For the past decade John has had the great pleasure of working in the Hong Kong office of a large UK architectural practice where he ascended through the ranks to the position of Director. During his time there his main responsibilities were management of the fast paced interior design team, as well as mentoring, supervising and reviewing the design process.</p>
					<p>John is very much ‘hands on’ when it comes to projects and his approach to design is holistic, believing that all aspects of a project should be considered throughout the journey, thus creating truly integrated design solutions. Examples of this philosophy are inherent in projects in which he was previously involved, such as Elements Mall, Hong Kong; IAPM Mall, Shanghai; IFC Mall, Shanghai; and Seoul International Finance Centre, Korea.</p>

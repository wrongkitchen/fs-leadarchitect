					<p>Experience: Retail planning, interior design, retail architecture, urban design, masterplanning and branding.</p>

					<p>Biography: With 2 years in Kenya as a child Simon sadly missed seeing the 1966 World Cup but grew up on safari instead. After schooling in Oxfordshire, where he represented the school at Soccer, Cross Country and Chess, he went on to University in Nottingham for his RIBA parts 1 & 2 and followed up with RIBA Part 3 in 1987.</p>

					<p>Having worked at Benoy for 9 years from 1986, he then left to work for a developer in Kuala Lumpur for 2 years and discovered his affection for Asia. After re-joining Benoy in 1997 he volunteered for the Hong Kong opportunity in 2001, and has lived here ever since.</p>

					<p>Over the past ten years he has been actively involved in many Asian mixed-use projects, such as Elements Mall Hong Kong, Pudong International Finance Centre Shanghai, IAPM/ICC Shanghai, ION Orchard Singapore and Indigo mixed-use development Beijing to name but a few. During this time, Simon used his capacity as a specialist in commercial design to expand the business practice into areas such as masterplanning, hotels, towers, offices, cultural buildings and transport hubs.</p>
					<p>Simon is currently working with developers of major regional and international reputation, focusing on business development whilst concurrently developing Lead operations and the brand.</p>
					<p>He is actively involved in conferences and seminars and participates in many government bodies and design briefings. Although he enjoys the excitement and challenge of leading the business, design is his primary joy and is most at home when working on new design ideas.</p>
					<p>Likes: Being married, sailing yachts, movies, the theatre, art galleries, Greek islands, wine tours, tiramisu, the sea, painting and drawing, English pubs and ales, the National Trust, golf, (but only when he’s having a good day!), real towns, dog-walking, Sai Kung country park, Poi Toi fried squid, Datai Bay (Langkawi), Mojitos …</p>

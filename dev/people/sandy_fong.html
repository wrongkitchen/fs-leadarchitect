					<p>Experience: Organisation and management of offices and facilities</p>

					<p>Biography: Sandy was born and lives in Hong Kong. She is vital to the smooth running of the studio, ensuring we are all well looked after. Her skills stretch far beyond the call of duty, to date we have been treated to her home made mango pudding (amazing) and even ice cream on a hot Friday afternoon!</p>

					<p>Richard graduated from the Oxford Brookes University in the UK, and then worked in Oxford for a design practice, which specialised in institutional developments and heritage building regeneration. He is a registered architect in the UK and also a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).</p>
					<p>Likes: Cooking delicious foods and desserts </p>

					<p>Thinks: Look after your family and your health</p>

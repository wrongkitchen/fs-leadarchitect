					<p>Experience: Retail interior design, retail architecture and planning, commercial interior design</p>

					<p>Biography: Ada is a Divisional Director at Lead and has over 10 years of experience in interior design. She has been involved in numerous award-winning projects and worked with renowned international developers and architects over the past 10 years. With her all-round skills and knowledge, Ada is capable of generating creative concepts, executing fine technical details and ultimately realising effective solutions.</p>
					<p>Ada received training as an Architect at the University of Hong Kong and continued her studies in Stage Design in the UK. Having spent a few years practicing Event and Stage Setting in this glamorous industry she decided to apply her refreshing approach to the field of retail architecture.</p>
					<p>Ada believes design is all about quality of life and that a designer creates experiences. With this approach she has successfully completed a number of prestigious retail projects, all of which are well known for the inclusion of human elements and hospitality; namely Hysan Place (HK), Elements (HK) and Shanghai IFC. These benchmark projects are well recognised by international awards and she has effectively established new standards in retail design.</p>
					<p>Alongside her experience in retail architecture, she has worked on airport projects and commercial developments, such as the Jardine House Renovation, and interior designs for a number of office towers. Over the past 10 years Ada has built up her portfolio with experience working across Asia, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Korea, and Singapore.</p>

					<p>Likes: Travelling a lot before entering parenthood (and I still do). Capturing touching moments with my camera (i.e. photography)</p> 

					<p>Thinks: Beautiful things don't seek attention.</p>

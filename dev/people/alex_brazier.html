					<p>Experience: Art direction, graphic design, web design, design management, creative direction.</p>

					<p>Biography: Alex joined Lead in the role of Creative Director. He brings with him over 13 years of design experience primarily in integrating brands with customer experiences and within the field of commercial retail.</p>
					<p>Alex’s experience originates in London where he practiced with a variety of high profile companies and advertising agencies. His past projects have also led him to collaborate with companies in Hong Kong and China, gaining valuable experience in the culture and workings of the Asian market.</p>
					<p>Having now relocated to Hong Kong from the UK, Alex has made a commitment to the Lead business in Asia. His practical experience of design and art direction includes print graphics, television, radio, outdoor, point of sale and retail environments.</p>
					<p>Prior to Lead, Alex has worked with brands large and small including Premiership Football Clubs, an international charity and prolific UK furniture retailer Habitat – where he was responsible for a full brand audit and company repositioning exercise.</p>
					<p>Alex’s design and management experience is rooted in various sizes of businesses within the industry, including the well known architectural practice Foster + Partners, and most recently a large Hong Kong based multi-disciplinary practice.</p>
					<p>He has a defining faith in an integrated design approach and applies this to all disciplines within Lead. Alex is responsible for creating a strong and thorough brand for Lead, alongside developing our Asian business strategy with the Directors.</p>

					<p>Likes: Cycling fast, coffee and brownies, being in sunny countries, any water based sports, climbing the hills of Hong Kong, my wife and my twin daughters and film photography.</p>

					<p>Thinks: Nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect (theories of wabi-sabi).</p>
